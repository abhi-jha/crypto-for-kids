DOUGLAS, Ariz. Jan, 5. -- The two American army officers whose seizure Friday afternoon resulted in a fight between United States cavalrymen in which two of the latter were killed, one wounded and three taken prisoner, were captured on American soil, according to the announcement today by Colonel George H. Morgan, Arizona district commander, who ordered an investigation immediately after learning of the affair.

"The incident is closed as far as I am concerned," the colonel said. "It developed today there had been frequent sniping by Mexican patrols at our men in the vicinity of the place where the figthing took place, but I did not know of this until today. I think the precipitate action of the soldiers in crossing the line to rescue their officers who had been seized on United States soil partly was due to the enmity the Mexicans have shown toward them. It is a regrettable affair and there is no prospect of a repetition or any further local difficulty over it."

According to the report of the commander the cavalry troop had left Douglas Friday for a practice march, most of the members being recruits, and at noon had camped in the vicinity of the Slaughter ranch, 18 miles east of here. Serveral hunting parties were formed, among them being one composed of Captain David H. Blakelock and Lieutenant George J. Lind. When the officers were within approximately 200 yards of the international line and headed east they suddenly were covered by the guns of four armed Mexicans, commanded to halt and informed they were prisoners. At the same time four Mexican customs officers opened fire upon a party of three privates, soldiers who were rabbit-hunting farther away from the line and about 200 yards from the officers. Two of the soldiers dropped to earth and returned the fire, holdng their ground while the third ran to camp to tell his comrades what had taken place.
