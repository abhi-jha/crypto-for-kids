**Demonstrate the power of exponential growth.**

From Wikipedia: "In the DES block cipher, 56-bit key is used, resulting in a relatively small key space of size 2^56, which was demonstrated in 1998 could be searched exhaustively in 56 hours with a desktop computer."

A 56 bit key may look like this: "A56!/g="

What if we added one character? "A56!/g=y"

It would take one and half year to break.

What about two more characters? "A56!/g=yP"

It would take 419 years to break.

A key with yet one more character ("A56!/g=yP2&") would result in 100000 year search.
