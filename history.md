**This is a list of historical topics to cover.**

* Scytale as an example of transposition cipher
* Trithemius/Alberti/Vigenere/Babbage -- polyalphabetic ciphers
* Cypherpunks
* Crypto wars
* Bitcoin
* Stuxnet
* I like the DAO hack story as a cautionary tale about crypto not bring sufficient by itself. More thinking needed.

The following stories are endlessly repeated elsewhere, so I am tempted to omit them:

1. Enigma
2. Code talkers
3. Early computer hackers
