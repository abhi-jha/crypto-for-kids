Dear Grandma,

I hope you are well. Also, best wishes for you birthday last month.

I am writing you because I have a problem you may be able to solve.

You've been visiting us recently and so you know how we always figth with Judy about splitting of the chores. You may have also noticed that Judy is much louder than I am and also a big whiner. In the end that means that I am always assigned more work than Judy. And that's not fair.

I know that Judy -- although she ignores whatever she is said -- actually respects you and often does what you say. Can you please write her a letter and ask her to play fair?

With love,
Toddy

Dear Grandma,

I've shown your letter to Judy. She read it and said that she recognizes the system. She said it was used by prisoners in concentration camps. When they had to split bread, one would cut it in two, the other one would choose the half to take. You could have told me. I am not a little boy anymore, you know.

Anyway, we've tried it with chores. I've spent two hours devising a perfect split. It went into smallest details assigning even tasks like vacuuming between radiator fins which we do, like, twice a year. If we had adopted that plan everything would have been well. However, Judy spoiled everything and choose the part I was planning to do. How is that supposed to be fair?

With love,
Toddy

Dear Grandma,

We've tried re-splitting the chores maybe twenty or thirty times in a row. First I proposed a split and Judy chose the easier part. Then I proposed a different split and Judy again took the easier part. When that went on for a while I said it was not fair and that I want to choose as well. So Judy proposed a split and I chose the easy half (no vacuuming!) Then she proposed a different split with vacuuming of ground floor in one part and vacuuming of top floor in the other part. There was no way to avoid vacuuming altogether. Anyway, after like two hours we've got a split that we were both happy with.

So, thanks for the advice. It may work in the end. And the best thing is that Judy can't whine now. If she does I would just propose to exchange our chores. And she knows that so she doesn't even try.

With love,
Toddy

Dear Grandma,

It turns out to be more complicated than I thought. I felt I've been doing more work than Judy so I proposed to add vacuuming of the guest room to her chores. I was right because she accepted it. The I proposed adding vacuuming of the small toilet by the guest room to her chores and she accepted it again. Then I proposed that she vacuums my room as well and she chose to exchange the chores. Now I was left with almost all of the vacuuming!

Now here comes the unfair part: I've backtracked and proposed that she doesn't vacuum my room, just the guest room and the toilet. And she REFUSED to exchange to chores back. That's unfair! She agreed with that before! Can you please write her and say that people should always keep their word?

Thanks!
Toddy

Dear Grandma,

Yes, I understand that I've challenged the status quo and that I should bear the consequences. The things have moved on here though. As angry as I was I stopped caring about keeping the living room (to be cleaned up by Judy) clean. I mean, if she doesn't bother to keep her word why should I make life easier for here?

Judy yelled at me and made a mess in the kitchen (to be cleaned up by me).

This is getting ridiculous. Now we both have more work to do than we used to while we were figthing. Can you please write her a letter and ask her to stop?

Thanks!
Todd
