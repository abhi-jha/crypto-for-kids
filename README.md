# Crypto for Kids

![cryptotalk](cryptotalk.png)

This project is a dumping ground for texts that will one day form a cryptography book for kids.

The goal of the book is to avoid as much technical detail as possible and focus on basic principles and the kind of thinking needed for crypto. As such the book will also touch adjacent subjects such as game theory, psychology, maths, economics, history and so on.

The book itself is going to be a mystery, or a puzzle. It will be split into smaller pieces and the correct ordering of the pieces will be revealed only by solving small crypto puzzles. With this hyperlink structure (think cross between Khazar dictionary and Garden of Forking Paths) it is even possible to make the book non-linear. One option would be to add short side branches ("eater eggs") the other would be to create a full-scale labyrinth. In the latter case the only way to explore the book will be drawing a map as you do when playing D&D.

Individual pages will be either texts about cryptography or short stories.

The stories will be mostly structured like this: First, something impossible happens. Then the reader will be told: "How is that possible?" or "You now have enough information to solve the mystery yourself!" The final part of the story will resolve the mystery -- but there's a catch: It will be encrypted, obfuscated or otherwise (e.g. steganographically) hidden. If you want to know the solution you have to either solve it yourself or decipher the answer.

In short, the book itself will use crypto and game theory to make the reader do what it wants.
