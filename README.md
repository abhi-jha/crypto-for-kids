# Crypto for Kids

![cryptotalk](cryptotalk.png)

This project is a dumping ground for texts that will one day form a cryptography book for kids.

The goal of the book is to avoid as much technical detail as possible and focus on basic principles and the kind of thinking needed for crypto. As such the book will also touch adjacent subjects such as game theory, psychology, maths, history and so on.

The book itself is going to be a mystery, or a puzzle. It will be online only and will have no index or linear ordering of chapters. Instead, it will be a web linked by hyperlinks (a la Khazar Dictionary). Most of the web will be compact and easy to find. Some parts will be not that easy to find (e.g. a link inside an encrypted text). To make it even more mysterious, scraping by the serach engines will be disabled. The only way to explore the book will be drawing a map as you do when playing D&D.

Individual pages will be either texts about cryptography or short stories.

The stories will be mostly structured like this: First, something impossible happens. Then the reader will be told: "How is that possible?" or "You now have enough information to solve the mystery yourself!" The final part of the story will resolve the mystery -- but there's a catch: It will be encrypted, obfuscated or otherwise (e.g. steganographically) hidden. If you want to know the solution you have to either solve it yourself or decipher the answer.

In short, the book itself will use crypto and game theory to make the reader do what it wants.
