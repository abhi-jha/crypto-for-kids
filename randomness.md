**Goal: Explain why randomness is important for crypto.**

### Randomness

This is a placeholder. No good ideas yet.

The thing is a natural follow-up to OTP (if the pad is not fully random, the encryption is weak), but that may be too complex.

Alternative: Rock-paper-scissors game. The game is perfectly fair as long as participants act randomly. If they do not, it's easy to win.

There should be a link to something like this, so that reader can get hands-on experience with how hard is it to be actually random: <http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nick/aaronson-oracle/index.html>
