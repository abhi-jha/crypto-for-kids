**Goal: Explain why randomness is important for crypto.**

### Randomness

This is a placeholder. No good ideas yet.

The thing is a natural follow-up to OTP (if the pad is not fully random, the encryption is weak), but that may be too complex.

Alternative: Rock-paper-scissors game. The game is perfectly fair as long as participants act randomly. If they do not, it's easy to win.

There should be a link to something like this, so that reader can get hands-on experience with how hard is it to be actually random: <http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nick/aaronson-oracle/index.html>

A trick: "Human randomness, such as moving the mouse is often used as source of randomness. Next section is section 273." However, there are two 273. sections in the book. The version of the story you read depends on whether you've happened to find the first or the second one.

Not sure this will be useful, but it's interesting:

"Some criminals also claim to be mentally retarded, especially in states where it’s illegal to execute retarded people. The process for catching these people is equally elegant. They are asked to take a multiple-choice vocabulary test with easy, medium, and difficult words. Real mentally retarded people will do okay on the easy words but perform at chance on the medium and difficult words. Fakers will also do okay on the easy words – they are smart enough to understand that even mentally retarded people know some things – but then they intentionally throw the medium words and do worse than chance. On the difficult words, the fakers honestly don’t know them and so they go back to performing at chance again. Computers can detect these patterns and easily and confidently point out a fake."
