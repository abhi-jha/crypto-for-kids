**A sequence of topics to give some understanding of complexity, that no all problems are created equal, etc.**

Complexity is a boring, complex, mathy topic. We should be careful here.

Here's the idea:

1. Start with Sibyl attacks. They are easy to explain, easy to empathize with. Someone is not playing fair after all.
2. Show how proof of work ("dig a hole 1m deep") can sidestep the problem.
3. Captchas. But what about robots (AIs)? If Weyland corporation creates a super-captcha-cracking robot is it fair that they can do Sibyl attacks? (This connects maths to ethics and calls for a story.)
4. Are there problems that are equally hard for everyone?
5. What's "brute force"? Are there any problems that can be solved only by brute force?
6. Factorization to primes.
7. Discrete logarithm.
8. Eliptic curves. These three are intrinsically mathy, but it should be possible to give an intuitive explanation without going into too much details.
9. We don't know whether these problems are really hard. A story about Schor/quantum computers.
10. Are there any alternative crypto systems? Yes, but they are not used. A story about conservativism in cryptography.
