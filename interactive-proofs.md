**Shows that two people can observe the same interactive proof and one of them can be sure about the outcome, while the second one will have no idea whether the proof is valid or not.**

### 1

Exam at school is an interactive proof. Teacher asks questions and pupil responds. If multiple questions are answered correctly teacher is reasonably sure that the pupil knows the topic.

Are the classmates sure though? If the teacher and the pupil conspired they could decide on questions in advance and do a show for the rest of the class. The reason why classmates are convinced is that they view the teacher and the pupil as antagonists and don't expect them to cooperate.

Now imagine that the teacher needs a favour from pupil's parent. She may pass him the questions in advance and thus break the assumption.

Alternatively, same kind of interactive proof is used in pen and paper exams. If the questions are stolen the exam doesn't prove anything any more but a by-stander cannot tell the difference.
