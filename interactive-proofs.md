**Shows that two people can observe the same interactive proof and one of them can be sure about the outcome, while the second one will have no idea whether the proof is valid or not.**

Exam at school is an interactive proof. Teacher asks questions and pupil responds. If multiple questions are answered correctly teacher is reasonably sure that the pupil knows the topic.

Are the classmates sure though? If the teacher and the pupil conspired they could decide on questions in advance and do a show for the rest of the class. The reason why classmates are convinced is that they view the teacher and the pupil as antagonists and don't expect them to cooperate.

Now imagine that the teacher needs a favour from pupil's parent. She may pass him the questions in advance and thus break the assumption.

Alternatively, same kind of interactive proof is used in pen and paper exams. If the questions are stolen the exam doesn't prove anything any more but a by-stander cannot tell the difference.

Cons: The asymmetry of the setup (teacher vs. pupil) makes it kind of obvious and not at all interesting. The point becomes obvious only if the setup is symmetric: A, B, C are walking in the street. A proves something to B. C, who was listening to the entire conversation, has no idea whether the proof is valid or not.

X's works in recruitement and his work is assess other people's foreign language skills. What he typically does is that he asks the applicant to translate some radomly chosen words from Enlish to Spanish. He says: "Dog", the applicant replies "Perro". He says: "Cat", the applicant replies "Gato". After twenty or so such questions he's reasonably sure that the applicant speaks Spanish.

After doing this work for 40 years, X is about to retire and he's training his assistant to replace him in time. They meet the applicant, the assistent asks the questions (Dog, Cat etc.) and the applicant replies correctly (Perro, Gato etc.) X approves the applicant as beig fluent in Spanish.

Later on, the company that hired the applicant complains that the guy doesn't speak Spanish at all. What happened?

A meets B. He wants to check that B is from the same country or agency, that he've been present at a specific occassion or somesuch. They exchange few questions and answers with positive result. A is conviced. Later on they are joined by C. B examines C in the same way. A in convinced again, but it turns out that B and C conspired and C shouldn't have been trusted.

Pros: Brings human pattern-matching into the game. Given that procedure is done twice, reader assumes it will work the same both times. It does not.

Teller: "Exploit pattern recognition. I magically produce four silver dollars, one at a time, with the back of my hand toward you. Then I allow you to see the palm of my hand empty before a fifth coin appears. As Homo sapiens, you grasp the pattern, and take away the impression that I produced all five coins from a hand whose palm was empty."
