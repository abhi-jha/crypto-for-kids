**explain what entropy is**

NOTE: The idea here was to start with thermal entropy, then proceed to Shannon's entropy. Not sure whether it makes sense. It seems to stray too far away from crypto.

When one thinks of famous physicists the name of Albert Einstein naturally springs to mind. He profoundly changed our understanding of such fundamental concepts as time and space. However, there was another scientist, much less known, who may have been even more profound. Ludwig Boltzmann was not only the first one to provide deep analysis of what time is but he also cast a deep doubt on our understanding of universe as such and our place within it, a doubt that persists to this day.

The feat is even more remarkable given that Boltzmann lived before the era of modern physics, before theory of relativity, quantum physics and theoretical cosmology. While Einstein may be called the founder of this modern XX. century era in physics, Boltzmann, on the other hand, concludes the previous era, the XIX. century era of steam machines.

The problem Boltzmann was dealing with was time. All the laws of physics, the laws of classical mechanics as well as laws of quantum mechanics that were not yet known at Boltzmann's time are quite indifferent about time. If something may happen in one way it can also happen in the opposite way. The Earth orbits around the sun counter-clockwise as seen from above the North Pole. However, there is no law of physics that says it must not orbit clockwise. If a cup of coffee falls of a table and breaks there's no law saying that the atoms of the broken cup cannot all move is such a direction that the shards jump together to form an unbroken cup and then move upwards so that the cup jumps back on the table.

Yet, we always often see a cup breaking to pieces but never pieces recomposing themselves to form a cup.

"So what's going on here?" asked Boltzmann: "Are there any other laws of nature that we are missing?"

...

When you go to Zentralfriedhof, the central cemetery in Vienna you may find Boltzmann's grave. There's Boltzmann's bust, with puffy beard and everything. And beyond it, there's a block of white marble with an equation engraved at the top:

```
S = k . log W
```

...

Let me explain with a logarithm is. Imagine you have ten objects to pick from. After picking one, you want to let your friend know which it was. How long does the note sent to your friend has to be?

Well, you can number the objects. You put a sticker saying "0" on the first one, "1" on the second one and so on. The last one will be labeled "9". And the note can contain only a single digit.

```
log 10 = 1
```

In other words, to label 10 objects you need just a single digit. This assumes there are 10 digits. Of course, there are other counting systems such as binary, which has only two digits and if you wanted to use that you'd have to use a slightly different version of logarithm. However, it's a minor issue and it doesn't help with understanding entropy. Therefore, we will just ignore it and assume we have exactly 10 digits.

Now, what about it we had 100 objects? Single digit won't be enough to label those. We would need two digits. First object would have a sticker saying "00", second one "01" and so on until the last one is labeled "99".

```
log 100 = 2
```

Similarly, to label 1000 objects we need three digits. The numbers would range from 000 to 999.

```
log 1000 = 3
```

Now a trick question: What if you had only one object? How many digits would you need to label it?

This may not be completely obvious, but you'd need no digits. If your friend knows you had only one object to pick from he already knows which one you've picked. You can as well send him an empty note.

```
log 1 = 0
```

So what does Boltzmann's entropy formula really say? k is just a number (1.38065 x 10âˆ’23, in case you want to know) and doesn't matter much. The interesting part is "log W". W in number of states the experiment can be in. Thus, "log W" is number of digits you would need to fully describe the state of the experiment. Or, more generally, it says how long the description of the state must be.

...

Blah, blah. Boltzmann brain. 

So the chances are you are only a brain that assembled by accident in a senseless universe, being asleep and dreaming about galaxies, stars, planets, about your home town, your friends, about your dog and about the lunch you just had. As Mark Twain says in the final paragraphs of The Mysterious Stranger:

> "It is true, that which I have revealed to you; there is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all a dream, a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And you are but a thought, a vagrant thought, a useless thought, a homeless thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities!" [He vanished and left me apalled; for I knew, and realized, that all he said was true.]

On September 5th, 1906, Ludwig Bolzmann was found by his daughter Elsa, hanged on window crossbar in his room in the Italian holiday resort of Duino.
