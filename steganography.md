** Explain how to hide things in plain sight.**

### Steganography

Trithemius was an interesting character. Maybe we can make him a protagonist. Invocation of angels etc.

Speaking of magic, Fulcanelli with his Le Mystère des Cathédrales comes to mind as well.

And the chapter should definitely have a steganographic message hiddin in it. A message that would result if you took only uppercase letters should be relatively easy to write.

Here's a real-life steganography story: "Today, The Intercept released documents on election tampering from an NSA leaker. Later, the arrest warrant request for an NSA contractor named "Reality Winner" was published, showing how they tracked her down because she had printed out the documents and sent them to The Intercept. The document posted by the Intercept isn't the original PDF file, but a PDF containing the pictures of the printed version that was then later scanned in. The problem is that most new printers print nearly invisibly yellow dots that track down exactly when and where documents, any document, is printed. Because the NSA logs all printing jobs on its printers, it can use this to match up precisely who printed the document."

One thing that should be pointed out: She was not 100% clueless as she scanned the documents to get rid of metadata. That makes a good basis for a story.
