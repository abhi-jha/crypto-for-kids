**Explain how to hide things in plain sight.**

### Steganography

Trithemius was an interesting character. Maybe we can make him a protagonist. Invocation of angels etc.

Speaking of magic, Fulcanelli with his Le Mystère des Cathédrales comes to mind as well.

And the chapter should definitely have a steganographic message hiddin in it. A message that would result if you took only uppercase letters should be relatively easy to write.

Here's a real-life steganography story: "Today, The Intercept released documents on election tampering from an NSA leaker. Later, the arrest warrant request for an NSA contractor named "Reality Winner" was published, showing how they tracked her down because she had printed out the documents and sent them to The Intercept. The document posted by the Intercept isn't the original PDF file, but a PDF containing the pictures of the printed version that was then later scanned in. The problem is that most new printers print nearly invisibly yellow dots that track down exactly when and where documents, any document, is printed. Because the NSA logs all printing jobs on its printers, it can use this to match up precisely who printed the document."

One thing that should be pointed out: She was not 100% clueless as she scanned the documents to get rid of metadata. That makes a good basis for a story.

This can be stretched out to be a longer story. Let's say there's a leaker whow the authorities want to identify. First, when handing out secret documents, they add a number to doc's metadata (Explain what metadata are! There can even be a separate chapter about metadata.) The number identifies the employee the document was handed to. The leaker is smart though. She prints and scans the document thus making sure that there are no attached metadata. But the printer/scanner adds metadata of their own. Ouch! Game over. But let's say the leaker was smart enough to re-type the document. Well, it turns out that the authorities have handed a slightly different document to each employee. Few inconspicious words were replaced by synonyms. In such a case even re-typing doesn't work.

Another option: In Borges' Garden of Forking Paths the narrator, a German spy in England, kills a person to send a message to his superiors (the victim's name is the same as the name of the village where British artillery is located):

> What remains is unreal and unimportant. Madden broke in and arrested me. I have been condemned to hang. Abominably, I have yet triumphed! The secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin. Yesterday it was bombed. I read the news in the same English newspapers which were trying to solve the riddle of the murder of the learned Sinologist Stephen Albert by the unknown Yu Tsun. The Chief, however, had already solved this mystery. He knew that my problem was to shout, with my feeble voice, above the tumult of war, the name of the city called Albert, and that I had no other course open to me than to kill someone of that name. He does not know, for no one can, of my infinite penitence and sickness of the heart.
